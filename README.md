Taffybar setup with only inhabited workspaces shown, pretty Unicode decorations around workspace switcher/pager, window title/selector and layout title, cool color scheme made with colorize, and with CPU, MEM, BAT, tray, MPRIS, weather, DIY disk usage monitor (just monitors the FS mounted as /), and date.  Notification is in there but commented out (seriously, use the patched notify-odg from leolik).

Bugs: barPosition is set to Bottom, so drop-down menu of window selector will get messed up.  If you want it to work, looks like you're stuck using barPosition = Top
